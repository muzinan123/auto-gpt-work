# Auto-GPT-Work

Auto-GPT-Work is a Python-based AI agent project aimed at creating an autonomous GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) agent capable of executing diverse tasks and workflows using various tools.

## Project Overview

This project implements an AI agent with the following features:

- Autonomous decision-making capability
- Task planning and execution
- Integration of multiple tools to enhance functionality
- Self-improvement and learning ability

## Project Architecture
![11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1bc335d-f1a2-4e3b-84a9-36b675a32376)
The project consists of the following main components:

- `main.py`: Main program entry point for launching and running the AI Agent
- `AI Agent`: Core AI agent responsible for coordinating the work of various modules
- `Agent Core Logic`: Includes task planning, decision-making, and natural language processing functions
- `Toolset`: Includes various tools such as web search, file operations, data analysis, image processing, text processing, API calls, mathematical calculations, etc.
- `Utility Tools`: Contains helper functions and configuration management
- `External APIs and Services`: Integration with external systems, such as email servers

## Key Features

The AI agent includes the following main features:

1. Natural language understanding and generation
2. Task decomposition and planning
3. Execution of tasks using multiple tools
4. Decision making
5. Interaction with external APIs and services
6. Self-monitoring and error handling

## Toolset

The Tools folder contains various tools, including but not limited to:

- Web search tools
- File operation tools
- Data analysis tools
- Image processing tools
- Text processing tools
- API call tools
- Mathematical calculation tools
- Email tool (emailtool)

Each tool is designed as an independent module, allowing the AI agent to flexibly call upon them based on task requirements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/muzinan123/auto-gpt-work.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd auto-gpt-work

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To run the AI agent:

python main.py

You may need to configure specific environment variables or configuration files to customize the agent's behavior and capabilities. Please check the code or other documentation for more details.

## Customization and Extension

You can customize and extend the AI agent's functionality by:

1. Adding new tool modules to the toolset
2. Modifying the Agent Core Logic to change the agent's behavior and decision-making logic
3. Updating configuration files to adjust the agent's parameters and settings

## Adding New Tools

To add a new tool, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Python file in the toolset directory
2. Implement the tool's functionality
3. Integrate the new tool into the agent's main logic
4. Update configuration files (if necessary) to include settings for the new tool
